                    I have been studying for a bit over 5 years, I dropped school one year to work in the Netherlands but decided to finish
                    my Bachelor as I already spent a lot of time doing it so I might as well finish it. That being said, I had the
                    opportunity to go to a few countries and see multiple cultures apart from mine, so I consider myself a person that is
                    able to adapt really quickly, in general I love to travel and go to new countries so any job that provides me this
                    opportunity would be incredible for me.
